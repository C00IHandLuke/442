d=b
b=c
n=d
t=v
i=u
w=p
z=j
j=m
e=f
f=q

d. First I eliminated a simple cesar cipher then I used a frequency analysis 
to rank to top used letter in the cipher and then counted how many short words
were created by changing. I counted "is","it", "as", "in", "if", "to", "the",
"and", "was", "his" and "her".  Then I used the combination of the frequency
analysis and the short word count to improve my choices.
